## ✨ Overview
Welcome to the **Spam Message Detection App**! 🛡️  
This app uses **Machine Learning** to classify text messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** in real-time, with an **interactive and user-friendly interface** built using **Streamlit**.

---

## 🌟 Features
- 🔹 Preprocess messages: tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming  
- 🔹 **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for feature extraction  
- 🔹 Trained **ML model** predicts Spam vs. Not Spam  
- 🔹 Real-time interactive results in **Streamlit UI**  
- 🔹 Easy to **extend and deploy**

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection.git
cd spam-detection
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. **Open your browser** at the URL displayed in the terminal to start testing messages.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**:

   * Converts text to lowercase
   * Removes punctuation & stopwords
   * Stems words for better generalization

2. **Vectorization**:

   * Transforms preprocessed text using **TF-IDF**

3. **Prediction**:

   * Uses the trained ML model to classify messages

4. **Output**:

   * Streamlit shows whether the message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**
